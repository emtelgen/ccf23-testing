Could I work on a problem outside of my research for my project</p> <p>A.  Yes.   We encourage fellows to consider some small aspect of their own research to apply to their projects, but not all research can be readily adapted for cloud computing to contribute, especially with very limited time and budget.    If the project is related, even tangentially, to your current research project, and you feel your chosen project will advance your career or knowledge of cloud for later application, then by all means please pursue and present what you've learned. </p> <p>Q.  Do I have to use programming in my project?</p> <p>A.  Most of the examples provided in the fellowship talk about processing data with scripts such as R or Python and many researchers are using these for data analysis, but it's not required for a successful project.   You could install a program on a powerful virtual machine and show how to use that software along with cloud storage to tackle a large data set (for example).   Secondly there are many forms of cloud computing that are not traditional such as data systems which may use a GUI or a language like SQL. </p> <p>One important aspect of a successful project is \"workflow thinking\" or how could you design your process so that you could do it 100 times or with some form of automation.   That often requires programming but there are cloud systems that don't require programming (e.g. Azure Data Factory).    Accumulating and organizing data is a huge part of successful research and using cloud tools to facilitate that and documenting the process, advantages and costs would be a successful project.  </p> <p>Q. Do I have to use Virtual Machine as part of my project?</p> <p>No you don't, and in fact we encourage you to look for other services in the cloud to work with your data or your research processes. </p> <p>Q. Do I have to use services that we've covered in the sessions?</p> <p>A. Cloud companies provide many amazing services, and you are not limited to what we've talked about in the sessions.

Are there constraints on the things I want do with my project?  Can I do whatever I want?</p> <p>A.  Our goal is to facilitate your education and advancing your research program as it relates to cloud computing, and that is a very broad goal.  If you use the fellowship to develop only a small system to show what's possible or not possible, even on public data, that uses cloud computing, that is an acceptable project. </p> <p>Q. I want to make a web site or application for my project, can I use a VM?  how do I do that?</p> <p>A.  This is a common request and the cloud was invented in part to run web applications.  However web application design is a huge subject and the programming involved is almost as complex as any programming or data work you've done for your research.  We tend to discourage projects focused on web applications because of the work involved to both 1) create the infrastructure for a website (web server, storage, databases, possibly docker containers, etc) and 2) the web application itself (Python/PHP other language, HTML, Javascript, Style Sheets, etc). </p> <p>Azure has services for hosting websites but don't attempt this for your project unless you have previous experience making websites or web applications, or if you are up for the big challenge of learning webdev along with cloud computing because the research you are showing off is mostly complete.    Secondly web services must be on-line 24/7 and the cost may accumulate quickly.   </p> <p>Finally cybsecurity is a major issues for websites which present an open door to anyone on the Internet.   keeping your site secure is a major challenge so during development please turn it off when you are not using it, and consider that web applications are hacked routinely.  </p> <p>However if you are ready to devote the time and this is a goal for your and your advisor please come speak with us as we have experience creating research web applications and we will support you.   </p>"},{"location":"exercises/azure_portal_walkthrough/","title":"Exercise: Azure Portal Walk-through and Storage account creation","text":"<p>from MSU Cloud Computing Fellowship Session 1 </p>"},{"location":"exercises/azure_portal_walkthrough/#about","title":"About","text":"<p>This is an exercise and introduction to the web interface to manage Microsoft Azure cloud services.

Cloud storage is quite different from what most are used to related to saving a file to your disk or USB removable media or even our HPC.   During the previous workshop we created a VM but didn't use cloud storage, we simply create a VM \"virtual disk\" that is attached to the VM just like your hard drive is attached to your own computer.   However there are disadvantages to this :    1. the main OS disk is typically deleted when the VM is deleted, although you can create a 'durable' disk to share   1. the data on the main OS disk is tied to that Virtual Machine and hence that operating system, that is, it's typically inaccessible from other cloud services    1. it is limited in size and scope  The largest of virtual disks are around 1 TB.  Azure Cloud storage accounts are limited to 5 TB and you may have multiple storage accounts.    1. You can only move data to/from a virtual or shared disk storage using a virtual machine   1.

It's my own take on this topic written with researchers in mind.  However it should not replace Azure official documentation.  The link below has a great summary of how it's setup.  However you may ignore all the other sections in the \"Azure setup guide\" as this is geared for IT professionals adoption cloud for their own organization</p> <p>Microsoft Azure Documentation: Organize your Azure resources effectively</p> <p></p> <p>Azure is organized by directories of user accounts and subscriptions.  All resources must be created in exactly one \"subscription\" which is a method for billing and for setting permissions.  Your organizations \"directory\" is where your user account lives, but you may have access to multiple subscreiptions with one user.  MSU created a \"Cloud Computing Fellowship\" subscription for all activities and resources for this, and we added your MSU directory accounts this subscription.   </p> <p>Cloud computing components are known as \"resources,\" which AWS defines as \"an entity you can work with.\"   Anything you can create using a cloud interfaces is a \"resource.\"   </p> <p>To help with more organization, in Azure, resources belong to a resource group.   Resource groups can collect resources by project which could still have hundreds or just a few resources.  There is no restriction and up to you to organize how it works for you.  For example, a lab could have a resource group for each member, or perhaps a resource group for each project, and members collaborate on those projects.   </p> <p>It's also possible to restrict access to resource groups, e.g. a resource group for a project may only allow those who are working on the project access to that resource group.  Azure has other organizational tools such management groups across subscriptions, complex identity management and role-based access control (RBAC) that we won't cover here.  </p> <p>However, this is mostly for organization and resources may be accessed from one resource group to another, and even across subscriptions.   Applying this organization scheme requires practice and sometimes vigilance.   </p> <p>For most campuses, researchers will want to have their IT department create the subscriptions and billing as they often can get discounted prices or fee waivers.   When your research group is ready to pay for services here at MSU, see the link to the \"cloud services request form\" on https://tech.msu.edu/network/cloud-services/ </p> <p>Summary of top-down Azure Organization: </p> <ul> <li>Directory : (MSU account). All account must come from a directory (but an account can be multiple directories)<ul> <li>Management groups : we won't use these, for admins to manage multiple subscriptions)<ul> <li>Subscription : tied to a billing account, and where all resources are created.  <ul> <li>Resource Group : organizational tool for resources.  Think of it as a \"folder\" in your file system<ul> <li>Resource : any cloud entity you may work with (e.g. create, configure, destroy)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Finally, it is possible to log-in to the Azure portal (e.g. your MSU account) and not have a valid subscription and not be able to create or access any resources.  If you have never used Azure before, you may be asked to create a free trial.   If are a you need to use Azure (e.g. for training) and do not have access to an MSU subscription, you may want to use a non-MSU email address and create your own account.  </p> <p>Azure \"tags\" add added to resources (including resource groups) and are a way to identify and locate resources by search as for many other services.   They are optional but highly recommended to use a tagging scheme to help organize your resources and for cost analysis.

You can run a server on your laptop.   - The computer that runs the software is the 'host'  - A 'client' is software sends the message, and receives and interprets the response.   - the protocol is the method by which you exchange messages.   Now it is almost exclusively web (http) but there are many others  - the form the input message can take, and the form of the message that is returned is known as the API of the server.  it's the interface that you have to work with.   - port: a computer may run many servers for internal and external use.  Unix devised a system of numbered 'ports' (nbumber 01 to 64K), and when running a server you must tell the server which port to listen for messages.  Users of most software never have to know or think about ports.  </p> <p>The 'Client/server' model invented in the 60s is so successful that we use servers for our daily lives and don't think about it (except when the server is down).  This model of computing is important because it's at the basis for of cloud computing.  </p> <p>We often think of a server as a box, but in the model above, the server is in the software layer, but each of layers below provides services for that software to exchange messages with another computer.
